Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global movie rental company, is transitioning to an online streaming platform to compete with industry leaders like Netflix and Amazon Prime.

These insights will guide strategic decisions in inventory management, customer engagement, and regional marketing, positioning Rockbuster for success in the digital streaming market.

  ● What was the average rental duration for all videos?\
  ● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?\
  ● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?\
